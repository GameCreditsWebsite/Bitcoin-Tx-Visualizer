# Bitcoin-Tx-Visualizer
Visualizes new bitcoin transactions as they propagate through the network.

## Why
Since www.blockchain.info removed their ticker for new transactions, I felt something was missing.

## Run
- Clone or download repository
- Navigate to index.html
- See new transactions

## Third Party Libraries
